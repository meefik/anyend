NEUX is a nifty ecosystem for user experience development. It is a JavaScript frontend micro-library with reactivity states and views. The library has features and tools are suitable for building small single-page applications (SPA) or isolated UI components.

Here are the main concepts behind NEUX:

Minimum interaction with the library during development, more native JS code.
Instead of HTML templates and JSX, defining views as nested JS objects with a set of attributes that are completely equivalent to the attributes of native HTML elements.
Support for modern two-way reactivity.
Availability of standard components to implement the basic SPA functionality:
routing,
localization,
synchronization of states with persistent storage,
calling remote procedures on the backend.
Small library size ~ 8kb (4kb gzipped).
It is open source software under MIT license.
